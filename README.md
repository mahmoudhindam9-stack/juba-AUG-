# Restocash

A complete **restaurant management ERP** built on [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) + [Supabase](https://supabase.com), featuring integrated point-of-sale, multi-warehouse inventory, recipe/BOM stock tracking, multi-currency accounting, and HR modules. The UI is fully localized in Arabic (RTL).

> Status: actively developed. See `AGENTS.md` for the Lovable sync contract.

## Modules

| Module | Routes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin dashboard** | `/admin/*` | accounts, HR, mall, inventory, ledger, menu, orders, receipts, reports, users |
| **POS** | `/pos` | Table/order lifecycle, upsells, timer |
| **Captain** | `/captain` | Waiter-facing order station with QR |
| **Cashier Treasury** | `/cashier-treasury` | Till, payouts, transfers, currency conversion |
| **Menu** | `/menu` | Recipes linked to inventory ingredients |

## Key capabilities

- **Multi-currency**: EGP + USD with currency *coefficients* and journal-level conversion.
- **Atomic inventory**: recipe BOM deduction tied to order completion; tracking mode + multi-warehouse.
- **Ledger**: journal entries, Excel upload via `ArrayBuffer`, balance validation per currency.
- **Offline-friendly Supabase client**: graceful fallback fetch wrapper for local mode.

## Run locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, [pnpm or npm](AGENTS.md)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy env and fill in your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
   ```

> The committed `.env.example` keys are the project's public anon credentials and are safe to use for local development; replace them with your own project's values for production.

- Migrations live in [`supabase/migrations`](./supabase/migrations) — apply with `npx supabase db push` or via the dashboard.
- Generated types: [`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`](./src/integrations/supabase/types.ts)

## Notes for contributors

- Route files under `src/routes/` (e.g. `admin/ledger.tsx`, `inventory.tsx`, `pos.tsx`) are large and monolithic; prefer extracting to components/hooks.
- One-off repair scripts (`patch_*.cjs`, `fix_*.cjs`) accumulate in the repo root and are gitignored going forward — please delete any that are no longer needed.
